# Reply to "Forward as Attachment" and "Attached Forwarded Message" on Outlook.com

Reply to attached forwared messages on Outlook.com using Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, or Safari by using bookmarklets or native extensions. This plugin is useful when replying to messages that are forwarded automaticlly from another account in Outlook or Exchange Server as attachments to avoid problems with DMARC, SPF, or other policies blocking direct re-directs of messages to Outlook.com.
