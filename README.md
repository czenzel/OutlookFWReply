# The "Forward As Attachment" Power User Browser Extension for Outlook.com

Reply to attached forwared messages on Outlook.com using Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, or Safari by using bookmarklets or native extensions. This plugin is useful when replying to messages that are forwarded automaticlly from another account in Outlook or Exchange Server as attachments to avoid problems with DMARC, SPF, or other policies blocking direct re-directs of messages to Outlook.com.

My use of this plugin is to help me receive copies of my messages from my testing Exchange Server to Outlook.com and maintain a way to respond to users using the fastest communication method possible. I don't like to search for the addresses in a message so with this browser extension I can easily reply to any message with no problem.

## Disclaimer

This plugin was created by myself and I have no association with Microsoft. This plugin, extension, or its scripts are not officially supported by them. I will try my best to keep this updated with current and future versions of Outlook.com.

As you know in **2015** there is a new build of Outlook.com, also known as the Outlook.com Preview, coming to the Microsoft Office 365 line of products. We do our best to keep up to date, but I... myself... have not been able to get on the preview. If you are on the preview or can help some open Indie developers out let me know. As you know this code might and will probably break with the preview.

I take no repsonsibility for how you use this plugin, extension, or code on how you use it or whatever it does wrong. You are releasing all liability when using this code.
